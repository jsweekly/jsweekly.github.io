<p>The JavaScript core language features are defined in a standard called ECMA-262. The language defined in this standard is called ECMAScript, of which the JavaScript in the browser and Node.js environments are a superset. While browsers and Node.js may add more capabilities through additional objects and methods, the core of the language remains as defined in ECMAScript, which is why the ongoing development of ECMA-262 is vital to the success of JavaScript as a whole.</p>

<p>In 2007, JavaScript was at a crossroads. The popularity of Ajax was ushering in a new age of dynamic web applications while JavaScript hadn&#x2019;t changed since the third edition of ECMA-262 was published in 1999. TC-39, the committee responsible for driving the ECMAScript process, put together a large draft specification for ECMAScript 4. ECMAScript 4 was massive in scope, introducing changes both small and large to the language. Languages features included new syntax, modules, classes, classical inheritance, private object members, optional type annotations, and more.</p>

<p>The scope of the ECMAScript 4 changes caused a rift to form in TC-39, with some members feeling that the fourth edition was trying to accomplish too much. A group of leaders from Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft came up with an alternate proposal for the next version of ECMAScript that they initially called ECMAScript 3.1. The &#x201C;3.1&#x201D; was intended to show that this was an incremental change to the existing standard.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 3.1 introduced very few syntax changes, instead focusing on property attributes, native JSON support, and adding methods to already-existing objects. Although there was an early attempt to reconcile ECMAScript 3.1 and ECMAScript 4, this ultimately failed as the two camps had difficulty with the very different perspectives on how the language should grow.</p>

<p>In 2008, Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, announced that TC-39 would focus its efforts on standardizing ECMAScript 3.1. They would table the major syntax and feature changes of ECMAScript 4 until after the next version of ECMAScript was standardized, and all members of the committee would work to bring the best pieces of ECMAScript 3.1 and 4 together after that point into an effort initially nicknamed ECMAScript Harmony.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 3.1 was eventually standardized as the fifth edition of ECMA-262, also described as ECMAScript 5. The committee never released an ECMAScript 4 standard to avoid confusion with the now-defunct effort of the same name. Work then began on ECMAScript Harmony, with ECMAScript 6 being the first standard released in this new &#x201C;harmonious&#x201D; spirit.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 reached feature complete status in 2014. The features vary widely from completely new objects and patterns to syntax changes to new methods on existing objects. The exciting thing about ECMAScript 6 is that all of these changes are geared towards problems that developers are actually facing. And while it will still take time for adoption and implementation to reach the point where ECMAScript 6 is the minimum that developers can expect, there&#x2019;s a lot to be gained from a good understanding of what the future of JavaScript looks like.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-who-this-book-is-for">Who This Book is For</h3>

<p>This book is intended as a guide for those who are already familiar with JavaScript and ECMAScript 5. While a deep understanding of the language isn&#x2019;t necessary to use this book, it is helpful in understanding the differences between ECMAScript 5 and 6. In particular, this book is aimed at intermediate-to-advanced JavaScript developers (both browser and Node.js environments) who want to learn about the future of the language.</p>

<p>This book is not for beginners who have never written JavaScript. You will need to have a good basic understanding of the language to make use of this book.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-overview">Overview</h3>

<p><strong>Chapter 1: The Basics</strong> introduces the smallest changes in the language. These are the new features that don&#x2019;t necessarily introduce syntax changes, but rather are incremental changes on top of ECMAScript 5.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2: Functions</strong> discusses the various changes to functions. This includes the arrow function form, default parameters, rest parameters, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 3: Objects</strong> explains the changes to how objects are created, modified, and used. Topics include changes to object literal syntax, using symbols, and new reflection methods.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4: Classes</strong> introduces the first formal concept of classes in JavaScript. Often a point of confusion for those coming from other languages, the addition of class syntax in JavaScript makes the language more approachable to others and more concise for enthusiasts.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5: Arrays</strong> details the changes to native arrays and the interesting new ways they can be used in JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 6: Iterators and Generators</strong> discusses the addition of iterators and generators to the language. These features allow you to work with collections of data in powerful ways that were not possible in previous versions of JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 7: Collections</strong> details the new collection types of <code>Set</code>, <code>WeakSet</code>, <code>Map</code>, and <code>WeakMap</code>. These types expand on the usefulness of arrays by adding semantics, de-duping, and memory management designed specifically for JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 8: Proxies</strong> discusses the new proxy object that allows you to intercept every operation performed on an object. Proxies give developers unprecedented control over objects and, as such, unlimited possibilities for defining new interaction patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 9: Promises</strong> introduces promises as a new part of the language. Promises were a grassroots effort that eventually took off and gained in popularity due to extensive library support. ECMAScript 6 formalizes promises and makes them available by default.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10: Modules</strong> details the official module format for JavaScript. The intent is that these modules can replace the numerous ad-hoc module definition formats that have appeared over the years.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 11: Template Strings</strong> discusses the new built-in templating functionality. Template strings are designed to easily create DSLs in a secure way.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 12: Reflection</strong> introduces the formalized reflection API for JavaScript. Similar to other languages, ECMAScript 6 reflection allows you to inspect objects at a granular level, even if you didn&#x2019;t create the object.</p>

<h2 id="leanpub-auto-the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This chapter is a work-in-progress. All of the information it contains is accurate, however, there are pieces of content missing. Wherever possible, a &#x201C;TODO&#x201D; has been left indicating where more content will be added.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 makes a large number of changes on top of ECMAScript 5. Some of the changes are larger, such as adding new types or syntax, while others are quite small, providing incremental improvements on top of the language. This chapter covers those incremental improvements that likely won&#x2019;t gain a lot of attention but provide some important functionality that may make certain types of problems easier to solve.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-better-unicode-support">Better Unicode Support</h3>

<p>Prior to ECMAScript 6, JavaScript strings were based solely on the idea of 16-bit character encodings. All string properties and methods, such as <code>length</code> and <code>charAt()</code>, were based around the idea that every 16-bit sequence represented a single character. ECMAScript 5 allowed JavaScript engines to decide which of two encodings to use, either UCS-2 or UTF-16 (both encoding using 16-bit <em>code units</em>, making all observable operations the same). While it&#x2019;s true that all of the world&#x2019;s characters used to fit into 16 bits at one point in time, that is no longer the case.</p>

<p>Keeping within 16 bits wasn&#x2019;t possible for Unicode&#x2019;s stated goal of providing a globally unique identifier to every character in the world. These globally unique identifiers, called <em>code points</em>, are simply numbers starting at 0 (you might think of these as character codes, but there is subtle difference). A character encoding is responsible for encoding a code point into code units that are internally consistent. While UCS-2 had a one-to-one mapping of code point to code unit, UTF-16 is more variable.</p>

<p>The first 2^16 code points are represented as single 16-bit code units in UTF-16. This is called the <em>Basic Multilingual Plane</em> (BMP). Everything beyond that range is considered to be in a <em>supplementary plane</em>, where the code points can no longer be represented in just 16-bits. UTF-16 solves this problem by introducing <em>surrogate pairs</em> in which a single code point is represented by two 16-bit code units. That means any single character in a string can be either one code unit (for BMP, total of 16 bits) or two (for supplementary plane characters, total of 32 bits).</p>

<p>ECMAScript 5 kept all operations as working on 16-bit code units, meaning that you could get unexpected results from strings containing surrogate pairs. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">text</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"&#x20BB7;"</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">length</code><code class="p">);</code>           <code class="c1">// 2</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="sr">/^.$/</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">test</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// false</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">charAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">));</code>        <code class="c1">// ""</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">charAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">));</code>        <code class="c1">// ""</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">charCodeAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">));</code>    <code class="c1">// 55362</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">charCodeAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">));</code>    <code class="c1">// 57271</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this example, a single Unicode character is represented using surrogate pairs, and as such, the JavaScript string operations treat the string as having two 16-bit characters. That means <code>length</code> is 2, a regular expression trying to match a single character fails, and <code>charAt()</code> is unable to return a valid character string. The <code>charCodeAt()</code> method returns the appropriate 16-bit number for each code unit, but that is the closest you could get to the real value in ECMAScript 5.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 enforces encoding of strings in UTF-16. Standardizing on this character encoding means that the language can now support functionality designed to work specifically with surrogate pairs.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-codepointat-method">The codePointAt() Method</h4>

<p>The first example of fully supporting UTF-16 is the <code>codePointAt()</code> method, which can be used to retrieve the Unicode code point that maps to a given character. This method accepts the character position (not the code unit position) and returns an integer value:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">text</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"&#x20BB7;a"</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">codePointAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">));</code>   <code class="c1">// 134071</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">codePointAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">));</code>   <code class="c1">// 97</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The value returned is the Unicode code point value. For BMP characters, this will be the same result as using <code>charCodeAt()</code>, so the <code>"a"</code> returns 97. This method is the easiest way to determine if a given character is represented by one or two code points:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">is32Bit</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">c</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="k">return</code> <code class="nx">c</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">codePointAt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="o">&gt;</code> <code class="mh">0xFFFF</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">is32Bit</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"&#x20BB7;"</code><code class="p">));</code>         <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">is32Bit</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"a"</code><code class="p">));</code>          <code class="c1">// false</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The upper bound of 16-bit characters is represented in hexadecimal as <code>FFFF</code>, so any code point above that number must be represented by two code units.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-stringfromcodepoint">String.fromCodePoint()</h4>

<p>When ECMAScript provides a way to do something, it also tends to provide a way to do the reverse. You can use <code>codePointAt()</code> to retrieve the code point for a character in a string while <code>String.fromCodePoint()</code> produces a single-character string for the given code point. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">String</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">fromCodePoint</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">134071</code><code class="p">));</code>  <code class="c1">// "&#x20BB7;"</code>
</pre></div>

</div>
<p>You can think of <code>String.fromCodePoint()</code> as a more complete version of <code>String.fromCharCode()</code>. Each method has the same result for all characters in the BMP; the only difference is with characters outside of that range.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-escaping-non-bmp-characters">Escaping Non-BMP Characters</h4>

<p>ECMAScript 5 allows strings to contain 16-bit Unicode characters represented by an <em>escape sequence</em>. The escape sequence is the <code>\u</code> followed by four hexadecimal values. For example, the escape sequence <code>\u0061</code> represents the letter <code>"a"</code>:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"\u0061"</code><code class="p">);</code>      <code class="c1">// "a"</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you try to use an escape sequence with a number past <code>FFFF</code>, the upper bound of the BMP, then you can get some surprising results:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"\u20BB7"</code><code class="p">);</code>     <code class="c1">// "7"</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Since Unicode escape sequences were defined as always having exactly four hexadecimal characters, ECMAScript evaluates <code>\u20BB7</code> as two characters: <code>\u20BB</code> and <code>"7"</code>. The first character is unprintable and the second is the number 7.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 solves this problem by introducing an extended Unicode escape sequence where the hexadecimal numbers are contained within curly braces. This allows up to 8 hexadecimal characters to specify a single character:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"\u{20BB7}"</code><code class="p">);</code>     <code class="c1">// "&#x20BB7;"</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Using the extended escape sequence, the correct character is contained in the string.</p>


<h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-normalize-method">The normalize() Method</h4>

<p>Another interesting aspect of Unicode is that different characters may be considered equivalent for the purposes of sorting or other comparison-based operations. There are two ways to define these relationships. First, <em>canonical equivalence</em> means that two sequences of code points are considered interchangeable in all respects. That even means that a combination of two characters can be canonically equivalent to one character. The second relationship is <em>compatibility</em>, meaning that two sequences of code points having different appearances but can be used interchangeably in certain situations.</p>

<p>The important thing to understand is that due to these relationships, it&#x2019;s possible to have two strings that represent fundamentally the same text and yet have them contain different code point sequences. For example,
the character &#x201C;&#xE6;&#x201D; and the string &#x201C;ae&#x201D; may be used interchangeably even though they are different code points. These two strings would therefore be unequal in JavaScript unless they are normalized in some way.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 supports the four Unicode normalization forms through a new <code>normalize()</code> method on strings. This method optionally accepts a single parameter, one of <code>"NFC"</code> (default), <code>"NFD"</code>, <code>"NFKC"</code>, or <code>"NFKD"</code>. It&#x2019;s beyond the scope of this book to explain the differences between these four forms. Just keep in mind that, in order to be used, you must normalize both strings that are being compared to the same form. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">normalized</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">values</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">map</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="kd">function</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="k">return</code> <code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">normalize</code><code class="p">();</code>
<code class="p">});</code>
<code class="nx">normalized</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">sort</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="kd">function</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">first</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">first</code> <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="o">-</code><code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">first</code> <code class="o">===</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">});</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this code, the strings in a <code>values</code> array are converted into a normalized form so that the array can be sorted appropriately. You can accomplish the sort on the original array by calling <code>normalize()</code> as part of the comparator:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">values</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">sort</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="kd">function</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">first</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">firstNormalized</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">first</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">normalize</code><code class="p">(),</code>
        <code class="nx">secondNormalized</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">normalize</code><code class="p">();</code>

    <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">firstNormalized</code> <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="nx">secondNormalized</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="o">-</code><code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">firstNormalized</code> <code class="o">===</code> <code class="nx">secondNormalized</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">});</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Once again, the most important thing to remember is that both values must be normalized in the same way. These examples have used the default, NFC, but you can just as easily specify one of the others:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">values</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">sort</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="kd">function</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">first</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">firstNormalized</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">first</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">normalize</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"NFD"</code><code class="p">),</code>
        <code class="nx">secondNormalized</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">second</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">normalize</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"NFD"</code><code class="p">);</code>

    <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">firstNormalized</code> <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="nx">secondNormalized</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="o">-</code><code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">firstNormalized</code> <code class="o">===</code> <code class="nx">secondNormalized</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">});</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you&#x2019;ve never worried about Unicode normalization before, then you probably won&#x2019;t have much use for this method. However, knowing that it is available will help should you ever end up working on an internationalized application.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-regular-expression-u-flag">The Regular Expression u Flag</h4>

<p>Many common string operations are accomplished by using regular expressions. However, as noted earlier, regular expressions also work on the basis of 16-bit code units each representing a single character. That&#x2019;s why the single character match in the earlier example didn&#x2019;t work. To address this problem, ECMAScript 6 defines a new flag for regular expressions: <code>u</code> for &#x201C;Unicode&#x201D;.</p>

<p>When a regular expression has the <code>u</code> flag set, it switches modes to work on characters and not code units. That means the regular expression will no longer get confused about surrogate pairs in strings and can behave as expected. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">text</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"&#x20BB7;"</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">length</code><code class="p">);</code>           <code class="c1">// 2</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="sr">/^.$/</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">test</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// false</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="err">/^.$/u.test(text));     // true</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Adding the <code>u</code> flag allows the regular expression to correctly match the string by characters. Unfortunately, ECMAScript 6 does not have a way of determining how many code points are present in a string; fortunately, regular expressions can be used to figure it out:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">codePointLength</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>

<p>The regular expression in this example matches a both whitespace and non-whitespace characters, and is applied globally with Unicode enabled. The <code>result</code> contains an array of matches when there&#x2019;s at least one match, so the array length ends up being the number of code points in the string.</p>




<p>JavaScript strings have always lagged behind similar features of other languages. It was only in ECMAScript 5 that strings finally gained a <code>trim()</code> method, and ECMAScript 6 continues extending strings with new functionality.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-contains-startswith-endswith">contains(), startsWith(), endsWith()</h4>

<p>Developers have used <code>indexOf()</code> as a way to identify strings inside of other strings since JavaScript was first introduced. ECMAScript 6 adds three new methods whose purpose is to identify strings inside of other strings:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>contains()</code> - returns true if the given text is found anywhere within the string or false if not.</li>
  <li>
<code>startsWith()</code> - returns true if the given text is found at the beginning of the string or false if not.</li>
  <li>
<code>endsWith()</code> - returns true if the given text is found at the end of the string or false if not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these methods accepts two arguments: the text to search for and an optional location from which to start the search. When the second argument is omitted, <code>contains()</code> and <code>startsWith()</code> start search from the beginning of the string while <code>endsWith()</code> starts from the end. In effect, the second argument results in less of the string being searched. Here are some examples:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">msg</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"Hello world!"</code><code class="p">;</code>

</div>

<p>These three methods make it much easier to identify substrings without needing to worry about identifying their exact position.</p>



<h4 id="leanpub-auto-repeat">repeat()</h4>

<p>ECMAScript 6 also adds a <code>repeat()</code> method to strings. This method accepts a single argument, which is the number of times to repeat the string, and returns a new string that has the original string repeated the specified number of times. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"x"</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">repeat</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">3</code><code class="p">));</code>         <code class="c1">// "xxx"</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"hello"</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">repeat</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">2</code><code class="p">));</code>     <code class="c1">// "hellohello"</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"abc"</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">repeat</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">4</code><code class="p">));</code>       <code class="c1">// "abcabcabcabc"</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This method is really a convenience function above all else, which can be especially useful when dealing with text manipulation. One example where this functionality comes in useful is with code formatting utilities where you need to create indentation levels:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="c1">// indent using a specified number of spaces</code>
<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">indent</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">" "</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">repeat</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">size</code><code class="p">),</code>

</pre></div>

</div>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-the-regular-expression-y-flag">The Regular Expression y Flag</h4>

<p>ECMAScript 6 standardized the <code>y</code> flag after it had been implemented in Firefox as a proprietary extension to regular expressions. The <code>y</code> (sticky) flag indicates that the next match should be made starting with the value of <code>lastIndex</code> on the regular expression.</p>

<p>The <code>lastIndex</code> property indicates the position at which to start the match of a string and is set to <code>0</code> by default, meaning matches always start at the beginning of a string. You can, however, overwrite <code>lastIndex</code> to have it start from somewhere else:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="sr">/hello\d\s?/g</code><code class="p">,</code>
    <code class="nx">text</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"hello1 hello2 hello3"</code><code class="p">,</code>
    <code class="nx">result</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">exec</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">);</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">result</code><code class="p">[</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">]);</code>     <code class="c1">// "hello1 "</code>

<code class="nx">pattern</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">lastIndex</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">7</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="nx">result</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">exec</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">);</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">result</code><code class="p">[</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">]);</code>     <code class="c1">// "hello2 "</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this example, the regular expression matches the string <code>"hello"</code> followed by a number and optionally a whitespace character. The <code>g</code> flag is important as it allows the regular expression to use <code>lastIndex</code> when set (without it, matches always start at <code>0</code> regardless of the <code>lastIndex</code> value). The first call to <code>exec()</code> results in matching &#x201C;hello1&#x201D; first while the second call, with a <code>lastIndex</code> of 6, matches &#x201C;hello2&#x201D; first.</p>

<p>The sticky flag tells the regular expression to save the index of the next character after the last match in <code>lastIndex</code> whenever an operation is performed (in the previous example, 7 is the location of next character after &#x201C;hello1 &#x201C;). If an operation results in no match then <code>lastIndex</code> is set back to 0.</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="err">/hello\d\s?/y,</code>

</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Here, the same pattern is used but with the sticky flag instead of the global flag. The value of <code>lastIndex</code> changed to 7 after the first call to <code>exec()</code> and to 14 after the second call. Since the sticky flag is updating <code>lastIndex</code> for you, there&#x2019;s no need to keep track and manually update it yourself.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing to understand about the sticky flag is that sticky regular expressions have an implied <code>^</code> at the beginning, indicating that the pattern should match from the beginning of the input. For example, if the previous example is changed to not match the whitespace character, there are different results:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="err">/hello\d/y,</code>

<code class="nx">result</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">exec</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">text</code><code class="p">);</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">result</code><code class="p">);</code>                <code class="c1">// null</code>

</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Without matching the whitespace character, the <code>lastIndex</code> is set to 6 after the first call to <code>exec()</code>. That means the regular expression will be evaluating the string as if it were this:</p>



<p>Since there is an implied <code>^</code> at the beginning of the regular expression pattern, the pattern starts by matching <code>"h"</code> against the space and sees that they are not equivalent. The matching stops there and <code>null</code> is returned. The <code>lastIndex</code> property is reset to 0.</p>

<p>As with other regular expression flags, you can detect the presence of <code>y</code> by using a property. The <code>sticky</code> property is set to true with the sticky flag is present and false if not:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">pattern</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="err">/hello\d/y;</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">pattern</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">sticky</code><code class="p">);</code>    <code class="c1">// true</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The <code>sticky</code> property is read-only based on the presence of the flag and so cannot be changed in code.</p>


<h3 id="leanpub-auto-objectis">Object.is()</h3>

<p>When you want to compare two values, you&#x2019;re probably used to using either the equals operator (<code>==</code>) or the identically equals operator (<code>===</code>). Many prefer to use the latter to avoid type coercion during the comparison. However, even the identically equals operator isn&#x2019;t entirely accurate. For example, the values +0 and -0 are considered equal by <code>===</code> even though they are represented differently in the JavaScript engine. Also <code>NaN === NaN</code> returns <code>false</code>, which necessitates using <code>isNaN()</code> to detect <code>NaN</code> properly.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 introduces <code>Object.is()</code> to make up for the remaining quirks of the identically equals operator. This method accepts two arguments and returns <code>true</code> if the values are equivalent. Two values are considered equivalent when they are of the same type and have the same value. In many cases, <code>Object.is()</code> works the same as <code>===</code>. The only differences are that +0 and -0 are considered not equivalent and <code>NaN</code> is considered equivalent to <code>NaN</code>. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>In most cases you will probably still want to use <code>==</code> or <code>===</code> for comparing values, as special cases covered by <code>Object.is()</code> may not affect you directly.</p>

<h3 id="leanpub-auto-block-bindings">Block bindings</h3>

<p>Traditionally, one of the tricky parts of JavaScript has been the way that <code>var</code> declarations work. In most C-based languages, variables are created at the spot where the declaration occurs. In JavaScript, however, this is not the case. Variables declared using <code>var</code> are <em>hoisted</em> to the top of the function (or global scope) regardless of where the actual declaration occurs. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">getValue</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>

    <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">value</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"blue"</code><code class="p">;</code>

        <code class="c1">// other code</code>

        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="nx">value</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>

        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="kc">null</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">}</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with JavaScript, you might expect that the variable <code>value</code> is only defined if <code>condition</code> evaluates to true. In fact, the variable <code>value</code> is declared regardless. The JavaScript engine changes the function to look like this:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">getValue</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>

    <code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">value</code><code class="p">;</code>

    <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="nx">value</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"blue"</code><code class="p">;</code>

        <code class="c1">// other code</code>

        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="nx">value</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>

        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="kc">null</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">}</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The declaration of <code>value</code> is moved to the top (hoisted) while the initialization remains in the same spot. That means the variable <code>value</code> is actually still accessible from within the <code>else</code> clause, it just has a value of <code>undefined</code> because it hasn&#x2019;t been initialized.</p>

<p>It often takes new JavaScript developers some time to get used to declaration hoisting and this unique behavior can end up causing bugs. For this reason, ECMAScript 6 introduces block level scoping options to make the control of variable lifecycle a little more powerful.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-let-declarations">Let declarations</h4>

<p>The <code>let</code> declaration syntax is the same as for <code>var</code>. You can basically replace <code>var</code> with <code>let</code> to declare a variable but keep its scope to the current code block. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">getValue</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>

    <code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
        <code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">value</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"blue"</code><code class="p">;</code>

        <code class="c1">// other code</code>

        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="nx">value</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code> <code class="k">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>

        <code class="k">return</code> <code class="kc">null</code><code class="p">;</code>
    <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">}</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This function now behaves much closer to other C-based languages. The variable <code>value</code> is declared using <code>let</code> instead of <code>var</code>. That means the declaration is not hoisted to the top, and the variable <code>value</code> is destroyed once execution has flowed out of the <code>if</code> block. If <code>condition</code> evaluates to false, then <code>value</code> is never declared or initialized.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the areas where developers most want block level scoping of variables is with <code>for</code> loops. It&#x2019;s not uncommon to see code such as this:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="k">for</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">i</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">;</code> <code class="nx">i</code> <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="nx">items</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">length</code><code class="p">;</code> <code class="nx">i</code><code class="o">++</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="nx">process</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">items</code><code class="p">[</code><code class="nx">i</code><code class="p">]);</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="c1">// i is still accessible here</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In other languages, where block level scoping is the default, code like this works as intended. In JavaScript, the variable <code>i</code> is still accessible after the loop is completed because the <code>var</code> declaration was hoisted. Using <code>let</code> allows you to get the intended behavior:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="k">for</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">i</code><code class="o">=</code><code class="mi">0</code><code class="p">;</code> <code class="nx">i</code> <code class="o">&lt;</code> <code class="nx">items</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">length</code><code class="p">;</code> <code class="nx">i</code><code class="o">++</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="nx">process</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">items</code><code class="p">[</code><code class="nx">i</code><code class="p">]);</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="c1">// i is not accessible here</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this example, the variable <code>i</code> only exists within the <code>for</code> loop. Once the loop is complete, the variable is destroyed and is no longer accessible elsewhere.</p>



<p>Unlike <code>var</code>, <code>let</code> has no hoisting characteristics. A variable declared with <code>let</code> cannot be accessed until after the <code>let</code> statement. Attempting to do so results in a reference error:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">value</code><code class="p">);</code>     <code class="c1">// ReferenceError!</code>
    <code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">value</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"blue"</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="p">}</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this code, the variable <code>value</code> is defined and initialized using <code>let</code>, but that statement is never executed because the previous line throws an error.</p>

<p>If an identifier has already been defined in the block, then using the identifier in a <code>let</code> declaration causes an error to be thrown. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">count</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">30</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="c1">// Throws an error</code>
<code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">count</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">40</code><code class="p">;</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this example, <code>count</code> is declared twice, once with <code>var</code> and once with <code>let</code>. Because <code>let</code> will not redefine an identifier that already exists in the same scope, the declaration throws an error. No error is thrown if a <code>let</code> declaration creates a new variable in a scope with the same name as a variable in the containing scope, such as:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">count</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">30</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="c1">// Does not throw an error</code>
<code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>

    <code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">count</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">40</code><code class="p">;</code>

    <code class="c1">// more code</code>
<code class="p">}</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Here, the <code>let</code> declaration will not throw an error because it is creating a new variable called <code>count</code> within the <code>if</code> statement. This new variable shadows the global <code>count</code>, preventing access to it from within the <code>if</code> block.</p>

<p>The intent of <code>let</code> is to replace <code>var</code> long term, as the former behaves more like variable declarations in other languages. If you are writing JavaScript that will execute only in an ECMAScript 6 or higher environment, you may want to try using <code>let</code> exclusively and leaving <code>var</code> for other scripts that require backwards compatibility.</p>


<h4 id="leanpub-auto-constant-declarations">Constant declarations</h4>

<p>Another new way to define variables is to use the <code>const</code> declaration syntax. Variables declared using <code>const</code> are considered to be <em>constants</em>, so the value cannot be changed once set. For this reason, every <code>const</code> variable must be initialized. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="c1">// Valid constant</code>
<code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">MAX_ITEMS</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">30</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="c1">// Syntax error: missing initialization</code>
<code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">NAME</code><code class="p">;</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Constants are also block-level declarations, similar to <code>let</code>. That means constants are destroyed once execution flows out of the block in which they were declared and declarations are hoisted to the top of the block. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="k">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">condition</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">MAX_ITEMS</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">5</code><code class="p">;</code>

    <code class="c1">// more code</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="c1">// MAX_ITEMS isn't accessible here</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this code, the constant <code>MAX_ITEMS</code> is declared within and <code>if</code> statement. Once the statement finishes executing, <code>MAX_ITEMS</code> is destroyed and is not accessible outside of that block.</p>

<p>Also similar to <code>let</code>, an error is thrown whenever a <code>const</code> declaration is made with an identifier for an already-defined variable in the same scope. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if that variable was declared using <code>var</code> (for global or function scope) or <code>let</code> (for block scope). For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">message</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"Hello!"</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">age</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">25</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="c1">// Each of these would cause an error given the previous declarations</code>
<code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">message</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"Goodbye!"</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">age</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">30</code><code class="p">;</code>
</pre></div>

</div>


<h3 id="leanpub-auto-numbers">Numbers</h3>

<p>JavaScript numbers can be particularly complex due to the dual usage of a single type for both integers and floats. Numbers are stored in the IEEE 754 double precision floating point format, and that same format is used to represent both types of numbers. As one of the foundational data types of JavaScript (along with strings and booleans), numbers are quite important to JavaScript developers. Given the new emphasis on gaming and graphics in JavaScript, ECMAScript 6 sought to make working with numbers easier and more powerful.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-octal-and-binary-literals">Octal and Binary Literals</h4>

<p>ECMAScript 5 sought to simplify some common numerical errors by removing the previously-included octal integer literal notation in two places: <code>parseInt()</code> and strict mode. In ECMAScript 3 and earlier, octal numbers were represented with a leading <code>0</code> followed by any number of digits. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="c1">// ECMAScript 3</code>
<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">number</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">071</code><code class="p">;</code>       <code class="c1">// 57 in decimal</code>

<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">value1</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nb">parseInt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"71"</code><code class="p">);</code>    <code class="c1">// 71</code>
<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">value2</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nb">parseInt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"071"</code><code class="p">);</code>   <code class="c1">// 57</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Many developers were confused by this version of octal literal numbers, and many mistakes were made as a result of misunderstanding the effects of a leading zero in various places. The most egregious was in <code>parseInt()</code>, where a leading zero meant the value would be treated as an octal rather than a decimal. This led to one of Douglas Crockford&#x2019;s first JSLint rules: always use the second argument of <code>parseInt()</code> to specify how the string should be interpreted.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 5 cut down on the use of octal numbers. First, <code>parseInt()</code> was changed so that it ignores leading zeros in the first argument when there is no second argument. This means a number cannot accidentally be treated as octal anymore. The second change was to eliminate octal literal notation in strict mode. Attempting to use an octal literal in strict mode results in a syntax error.</p>

<div class="code-block">

<code class="p">}</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>By making these two changes, ECMAScript 5 sought to eliminate a lot of the confusion and errors associated with octal literals.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 took things a step further by reintroducing an octal literal notation, along with a binary literal notation. Both of these notations take a hint for the hexadecimal literal notation of prepending <code>0x</code>or <code>0X</code> to a value. The new octal literal format begins with <code>0o</code> or 0O<code> while the new binary literal format begins with </code>0b<code> or </code>0B`. Each literal type must be followed by one or more digits, 0-7 for octal, 0-1 for binary. Here&#x2019;s an example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="c1">// ECMAScript 6</code>
<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">value1</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">0</code><code class="nx">o71</code><code class="p">;</code>      <code class="c1">// 57 in decimal</code>
<code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">value2</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="mi">0</code><code class="nx">b101</code><code class="p">;</code>     <code class="c1">// 5 in decimal</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Adding these two literal types allows JavaScript developers to quickly and easily include numeric values in binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal formats, which is very important in certain types of mathematical operations.</p>

<p>The <code>parseInt()</code> method doesn&#x2019;t handle strings that look like octal or binary literals:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">parseInt</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"0o71"</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// 0</code>

</pre></div>

</div>

<p>However, the <code>Number()</code> function will convert a string containing octal or binary literals correctly:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"0o71"</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// 57</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"0b101"</code><code class="p">));</code>     <code class="c1">// 5</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>When using octal or binary literal in strings, be sure to understand your use case and use the most appropriate method for converting them into numeric values.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-isfinite-and-isnan">isFinite() and isNaN()</h4>

<p>JavaScript has long had a couple of global methods for identifying certain types of numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>isFinite()</code> determines if a value represents a finite number (not <code>Infinity</code> or <code>-Infinity</code>)</li>
  <li>
<code>isNaN()</code> determines if a value is <code>NaN</code> (since <code>NaN</code> is the only value that is not equal to itself)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although intended to work with numbers, these methods are capable of inferring a numeric value from and value that is passed in. That both methods can return incorrect results when passed a value that isn&#x2019;t a number. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">isFinite</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">25</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">isFinite</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"25"</code><code class="p">));</code>    <code class="c1">// true</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">isNaN</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="kc">NaN</code><code class="p">));</code>        <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">isNaN</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"NaN"</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// true</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>Both <code>isFinite()</code> and <code>isNaN()</code> pass their arguments through <code>Number()</code> to get a numeric value and then perform their comparisons on that numeric value rather than the original. This confusing outcome can lead to errors when value types are not checked before being used with one of these methods.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 adds two new methods that perform the same comparison but only for number values: <code>Number.isFinite()</code> and <code>Number.isNaN()</code>. These methods always return <code>false</code> when passed a non-number value and return the same values as their global counterparts when passed a number value:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">isFinite</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">25</code><code class="p">));</code>              <code class="c1">// true</code>

</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this code, <code>Number.isFinite("25")</code> returns <code>false</code> even though <code>isFinite("25")</code> returns <code>true</code>; likewise <code>Number.isNaN("NaN") returns </code>false<code> even though </code>isNaN(&#x201C;NaN&#x201D;)<code> returns </code>true`.</p>

<p>These two new methods are aimed at eliminating certain types of errors that can be caused when non-number values are used with <code>isFinite()</code> and <code>isNaN()</code> without dramatically changing the language.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-working-with-integers">Working with Integers</h4>

<p>A lot of confusion has been caused over the years related to JavaScript&#x2019;s single number type that is used to represent both integers and floats. The language goes through great pains to ensure that developers don&#x2019;t need to worry about the details, but problems still leak through from time to time. ECMAScript 6 seeks to address this by making it easier to identify and work with integers.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-identifying-integers">Identifying Integers</h5>

<p>The first addition is <code>Number.isInteger()</code>, which allows you to determine if a value represents an integer in JavaScript. Since integers and floats are stored differently, the JavaScript engine looks at the underlying representation of the value to make this determination. That means numbers that look like floats might actually be stored as integers and therefore return <code>true</code> from <code>Number.isInteger()</code>. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">25</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mf">25.0</code><code class="p">));</code>    <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mf">25.1</code><code class="p">));</code>    <code class="c1">// false</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>In this code, <code>Number.isInteger()</code> returns <code>true</code> for both <code>25</code> and <code>25.0</code> even though the latter looks like a float. Simply adding a decimal point to a number doesn&#x2019;t automatically make it a float in JavaScript. Since <code>25.0</code> is really just <code>25</code>, it is stored as an integer. The number <code>25.1</code>, however, is stored as a float because there is a fraction value.</p>

<h5 id="leanpub-auto-safe-integers">Safe Integers</h5>

<p>However, all is not so simple with integers. JavaScript can only accurately represent integers between -2<sup>53 and 2</sup>53, and outside of this &#x201C;safe&#x201D; range, binary representations end up reused for multiple numeric values. For example:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Math</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">pow</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">2</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="mi">53</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// 9007199254740992</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Math</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">pow</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">2</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="mi">53</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="o">+</code> <code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">);</code>  <code class="c1">// 9007199254740992</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>This example doesn&#x2019;t contain a typo, two different numbers end up represented by the same JavaScript integer. The effect becomes more prevalent the further the value is outside of the safe range.</p>

<p>ECMAScript 6 introduces <code>Number.isSafeInteger()</code> to better identify integers that can accurately be represented in the language. There is also <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code> and <code>Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER</code> that represent the upper and lower bounds of the same range, respectively. The <code>Number.isSafeInteger()</code> method ensures that a value is an integer and falls within the safe range of integer values:</p>

<div class="code-block">
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="kd">var</code> <code class="nx">inside</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code><code class="p">,</code>
    <code class="nx">outside</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">inside</code> <code class="o">+</code> <code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">;</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">inside</code><code class="p">));</code>          <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isSafeInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">inside</code><code class="p">));</code>      <code class="c1">// true</code>

<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">outside</code><code class="p">));</code>         <code class="c1">// true</code>
<code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Number</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isSafeInteger</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">outside</code><code class="p">));</code>     <code class="c1">// false</code>
</pre></div>

</div>

<p>The number <code>inside</code> is the largest safe integer, so it returns <code>true</code> for both <code>Number.isInteger()</code> and <code>Number.isSafeInteger()</code>. The number <code>outside</code> is the first questionable integer value, so it is no longer considered safe even though it&#x2019;s still an integer.</p>

<p>Most of the time, you only want to deal with safe integers when doing integer arithmetic or comparisons in JavaScript, so it&#x2019;s a good idea to use <code>Number.isSafeInteger()</code> as part of input validation.</p>

<h4 id="leanpub-auto-new-math-methods">New Math Methods</h4>

<p>The aforementioned new emphasis on gaming and graphics in JavaScript led to the realization that many mathematical calculations could be done more efficiently by a JavaScript engine than with pure JavaScript code. Optimization strategies like asm.js, which works on a subset of JavaScript to improve performance, need more information to perform calculations in the fastest way possible. It&#x2019;s important, for instance, to know whether the numbers should be treated as 32-bit integers or as 64-bit floats.</p>

<p>As a result, ECMAScript 6 adds several new methods to the <code>Math</code> object. These new methods are important for improving the speed of common mathematical calculations, and therefore, improving the speed of applications that must perform many calculations (such as graphics programs). The new methods are listed below.</p>
