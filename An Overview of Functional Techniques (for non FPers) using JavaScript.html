	<h2>What is Functional Programming?</h2>
    <div class="slide">
        <h3>No Single Definition</h3>
        <p>There is no clear, widely-accepted definition of Functional Programming.  It is a collection of
           related featues which cohere well into a very useful style of programming.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some of these features are readily available in Javascript.</li>
            <li>Others can be used if care is taken.</li>

    <h2>Chief difference between OOP and FP</h2>
    <p>Reg Braithwaite has a <a href="http://raganwald.com/2013/04/08/functional-vs-OOP.html">good description</a>
       of the central difference between these two paradigms.  OO focuses on the <em>differences</em> in the data,
       while FP concentrates on <em>consistent data structures</em>.</p>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>
            <h3>Object-Oriented</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data and the operations upon it are tightly coupled</li>
                <li>Objects hide their implementation of operations from other objects via their interfaces</li>
                <li>The central model for abstraction is the data itself</li>
                <li>The central activity is composing new objects and extending existing objects by adding new methods
                    to them</li>

                <li>Data is only loosely coupled to functions</li>
                <li>Functions hide their implementation, and the language&#x2019;s abstractions speak to functions and the way
                    they are combined or expressed</li>
                <li>The central model for abstraction is the function, not the data structure.</li>

    <h2>What does this mean in the business environment?</h2>
    <p>Is one of these techniques the clear-cut winner in the business world?  Is it functional or object-oriented?</p>
    <p class="slide">
        <h3>Are you sure?</h3>
    </p>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <h3>How much business logic is written like this?</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="code">SELECT orders.order_id, orders.order_date, suppliers.supplier_name
    FROM suppliers
    RIGHT OUTER JOIN orders
    ON suppliers.supplier_id = orders.supplier_id
    WHERE orders.order_status = 'INCOMPLETE'

            <br>
            <p>SQL is very similar to functional languages, and it permeates business.  It uses a consistent data structure
               (tables with records organized into columns) and a few basic functions that can be combined into
               arbitrary queries.  And it shares one other important feature with functional languages: it is
               <strong>declarative</strong>.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Declarative vs Imperative Programming</h2>
    <p>One main distinguishing characteristics of functional programming languages is that they describe <em>what</em>
        they want done, and not <em>how</em> to do it.  OO, inside its methods, still uses mostly imperative techniques.</p>

        <li class="slide">Pattern matching (Haskell, Erlang)</li>
        <li class="slide">Lazy Evaluation (Miranda, Haskell)</li>

    <div class="slide">
        
        <p>We will take a look a brief look at these functional programming features of other languages first, then turn
           our focus to those things we can actually accomplish in Javascript.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Shared Example</h2>
    <p>Following an example from <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2009/08/30/tail-call-optimization">Paul Barry</a>
       we will use the example of the chances of winning a lottery.  This calculates the odds of choosing the correct
       `n` numbers out of the `p` possibilities.</p>
    <p>Here is an iterative version of the code:</p>
    
    <br>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Recursive Version</h2>
    <p>This is similar, but written recursively:</p>
    

    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>There are many reasons that functional programmers prefer recursion, but one very simple one is that
           recursive functions are often much more elegant than their iterative cousins.  It's easier to reason
           about them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Unfortunately, they often don't perform as well.  All the overhead of creating stack contexts for
           function calls tends to add up.  But certain kinds of recursive calls <em>can</em> be easily optimized.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>This code in tail-call formulation:</h2>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>Note that the recursive call in <code>odds1</code> is the last statement in its branch of the function.
           If this is true for all recursive calls, then the function is <code>tail-recursive</code>, and the
           compiler can replace the entire set of nested calls with simple <code>JUMP</code> operations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Such optimizations are required by many functional languages.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>This is slated to become required in the next version of the specification for Javascript, but it won't
           be consistently available client-side for some time.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
    <p>Some languages make use of an interesting techniqe to define functions: pattern matching.  Rather than use
       <code>if-blocks</code> in the body of the function, parameter-matching is used to choose which of a collection
        of related functions should be called.  Here we can see it in Erlang.</p>
    
    

</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Lazy Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Many of us are most familiar with languages that evaluate their expressions as soon as they're encountered.  But
       there are some that wait until the last possible instant.  This can have some real benefits.</p>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>We'll switch examples here, as there's not much call to do lazy evaluation for lottery odds.  We will follow a
           <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/284180/1243641">Haskell example</a> from Chris Eidhof</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>Note that the right half of quicksort is not calculated in finding the minimum. (Also note the pattern matching here too!)</p>
    </div>
    <p class="slide">One <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2165370/1243641">very interesting comparison</a> is that
       lazy evaluation is to the CPU what garbage collection is to memory.  The garbage collector allows you to pretend
       that you have infinite memory; lazy evaluation allows you to pretend that you have infinite processing power.</p>
    <p class="slide">But there are many reasons to like lazy evaluation.  It allows you to operate on theoretically
       infinite data structures, calculating only those parts you need.  And it allows you to define your own
       efficient control structures inside the language instead of only at the level of the language syntax.</p>
    <br>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Homoiconicity</h2>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>No groaning.  At one time you had to learn what <em>polymorphism</em> meant, too!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="slide">
        <h3><em>homoiconicity</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><em>homo</em>: from the Greek <em>homo</em>, same</li>
            <li><em>icon</em>: from the Greek <em>eikon</em>, likeness, image, portrait</li>
            <li><em>icity</em>: from the Greek <em>icit</em>, extra letters to make words more pretentious</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Homoiconicity in LISP-like languages</h2>
    <p>Homoiconicity has to do with the fact that in some languages, programs are written in a format easily
       interpreted also as a data structure.  In Scheme, the following is just a quoted list of three items,
       <code>define</code>, <code>(square x)</code> (itself a list), and <code>(* x x)</code> (another list)</p>
    <div>
        <p class="code">'(define (square x) (* x x))</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>But the following, which looks almost identical, is a function definition:</p>
        <div>
            <p class="code">(define (square x) (* x x))</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>LISP-like languages can use this feature to build very powerful domain-specific languages.  Many would
           claim that this is the key feature that has allowed LISP to become the oldest language still in widespread
           use.</p>
    </div>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Functional Programming in Javascript</h2>
    <p>With first-class function, closures, and anonymous functions, Javascript allows us to do a great deal of
        functional programming, even if we don't have things like pattern matching and homoiconicity.  There are
        some tools built in to modern Javascript environments, and it's straightforward to roll your own.</p>
    <p>For the remainder of this talk, we will use the <a href="https://github.com/CrossEye/ramda">Ramda</a> library that
        <a href="https://github.com/buzzdecafe">Michael Hurley</a> and I have been developing.  But there are a number
        of interesting alternatives available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="slide"><a href="https://github.com/raganwald/allong.es">allong.es</a> is a fairly new functional
            combinators and decorators library</li>
        <li class="slide"><a href="https://github.com/fogus/lemonad">Lemonad</a> is a general-purpose functional
            programming library</li>
        <li class="slide"><a href="https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js">Lazy</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/lz">Lz</a> are libraries for lazy list processing</li>
        <li class="slide"><a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore</a> and its more performant clone,
            <a href="http://lodash.com/">Lo-Dash</a>, are general utility libraries with a number of functional
            capabilities</li>
        <li class="slide"><a href="http://osteele.com/sources/javascript/functional/">Functional Javascript</a>,
            although perhaps outdated today, was the very first successful functional programming library for
            Javascript</li>
    </ul>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Using Functional Techniques in Javacript</h2>
    <p>We will approach functional programming by converting an imperative example into a functional one.</p>
    <p>We will also briefly examine an object-oriented approach, but we'll see that the code that we would like
        to address is very similar to the imperative one, just organized differently.</p>
    <p>Our example will be a Task List application, fetching something like the following data from the server:</p>
    
    <br>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    
    <br>
    <p>The goal will be a function that accepts a `member` parameter, then fetches the data from the server (or from
        some application cache), chooses the tasks for that member that are not complete, returns their ids, priorities,
        titles, and dues dates, sorted by due date.</p>
    <p>Since the fetch from the server will likely be asynchronous, we'll hook everything together with promises, and
        our function will return a promise that should resolve to an array of objects with the required properties.</p>
    <p>For our illustrative purposes, we will ignore all error-checking concerns.  Obviously in a production system,
        we would need to consider server-side failures, and bad data scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Sample Imperative Approach</h2>

    <h2>Sample Imperative Approach (continued)</h2>

    <h2>Similar Object-Oriented Approach</h2>

    <h2>Object-Oriented Approach (continued)</h2>
    
    <br>
    <p>(continued on the next slide.)</p>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Object-Oriented Approach (continued)</h2>
    
    <br>
    <p>We could continue by defining <code>Task</code> and <code>MinimalTask</code>, but that's probably overkill in
        Javascript.</p>
    <p class="slide">It's important for our point to note that the difference between the plain imperative code and the
        Object-Oriented code, outside a number of `<code>this</code>` keywords, is mostly just organization.  The
        contents of the functions are much the same; it's the way they are organized that varies.</p>
    <p class="slide">This means that for our purposes, we can focus on the slightly simpler imperative code.</p>
</section>




<section class="slide">
    <h2>Converting to Functional Code</h2>
    <p>The process for the remainder of this talk will be to convert this code into concise, readable, functional
        code, one block at a time, explaining some of the basic building blocks of functional programming as we go.
        First up is this little function:</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>So the obvious question, then, is, what is the <code>get</code> function?</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>The <code>get</code> Function</h2>
    <p>This is the definition of the <code>get</code> function in the Ramda library:</p>
    
    <br>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Ignoring the <code>curry</code> wrapper, this is pretty simple.  <code>get</code> (which also goes by the
            alias of <code>prop</code>) is a function which accepts a property name and an object, and returns the
            property of the object with that name.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>Our <code>then</code> call needs a function, so <code>curry</code> must be doing something interesting with
            this function, which should return an object propery, to instead returning a new function.  So we need to
            take a detour to discuss <code>curry</code> a bit.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Curry</h2>
    <img src="http://scott.sauyet.com/Javascript/Talk/2014/01/FuncProgTalk/img/curry.png">
    <p class="slide">
        <br>
        <h3>Very sorry, no delicious spicy food here.</h3>
    </p>
</section>




<section class="slide">
    <h2>Currying Functions</h2>
    <p>Currying is the process of converting functions that take multiple arguments into ones that, when supplied
        fewer arguments, return new functions that accept the remaining ones.</p>
    
</section>




<section class="slide">
    <h2>Currying multiple arguments</h2>
    <p>Different version of currying work slightly differently.  In Ramda, you can pass any of the arguments at any
        time to a curried function.  If the total arguments passed have not yet reached the required number, then
        you will get back a new function.  If you reach (or exceed) that number, you will get back the final result.</p>
    
    <div>
        <br>
        <p>Some insist that this is not truly currying, but should be called <code>partial application</code>.  They
            can feel free to call it what they like.  It serves the same role as currying does in a more strongly
            typed language.</p>
    </div>
</section>




<section class="slide">
    <h2>Back to <code>get</code></h2>
    <p>Remember the definition of <code>get</code>:</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>Now that we understand <code>curry</code>, we can see that a manually curried version of this function might
            look like this:</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>And that means that our new <code>get('tasks')</code> is equivalent to</p>
        
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Filtering</h2>
    <p>So far, we've been able to replace this block:</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>with this one:</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>The next block to replace looks like this:</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>What we're doing is running a filter on the input list, keeping only those that have the correct
            <code>member</code> property.  Let's see how we would do this in a functional paradigm.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Functional Filtering</h2>
    <p>Many functional libraries come with a <code>filter</code> function, which accepts a predicate function and
        a list, and returns a new list consisting of those elements of the original list for which the predicate
        function returns <code>true</code>.</p>
    <p>Ramda has one, called <code>filter</code>, and like pretty much every function of more than one parameter, it's
        curried, with the signature, <code>filter(predicate, list)</code>.</p>
    <p>Remembering that the <code>then</code> block will pass the list of tasks to us, we really want to call filter
        with a predicate, getting back a curried function that will accept a list.</p>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Here's a first pass:</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>(Remember that <code>memberName</code> was a parameter to our original function.)</p>
    </div>
</section>




<section class="slide">
    <h2>Focused Code</h2>
    <p>So, for one thing, we've reduced the weight of our custom code:</p>
    
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>But we've done something more important too:  We've moved the focus from iteration and updating the state
            of a local collection to the real point of this block: choosing the tasks with the proper
            <code>member</code> property.</p>
        <p>One of the most important features of functional programming is that it makes it easy to shift focus in
            this manner.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Rejecting elements</h2>
    <p>The next block is similar, except that instead of using <code>filter</code>, we will use <code>reject</code>,
        which behaves exactly the same except that it chooses those members of the list that <strong>don't</strong>
        match the predicate.  We replace this code:</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>with this:</p>
    
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Refactoring... already</h2>
    <p>A reasonable question would be why with didn't do this instead, which would work equally well:</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>The reason is that the similarity between these two blocks will offer us a chance to refactor our code
            into something still more descriptive:</p>
    
    <br>
    
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Both of these functions accept an object and return a boolean that describes whether a particular
            property of the object has a given value.  Perhaps a good name for a function that generates such
            functions would be <code>propEq</code>.  Let's implement that.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Implementing <code>propEq</code></h2>
    <h3>Simplest Approach</h3>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>This works, and we could leave it there, but we're going to take another detour into a popular style of
            functional programming known as <code>points-free</code> coding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>The name has nothing to do with <code>'.'</code> characters.  It derives from mathematics and has something
            to do with homomorphisms on topological spaces.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't worry&#x2026;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>This won't be on the test.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Points-free definitions</h2>
    <p>With the functions <code>add</code> (which adds two numbers) and <code>reduce</code> (which runs the supplied
        function against an accumulator and each element of the list, feeding the result of each call into the next one
        and returning the final result), we can easily define a <code>sum</code> function like this:</p>
    
    <br>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>Because of the automatic currying, though, the following is entirely equivalent:</p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>This is the points-free style, defining functions without ever making direct reference to their
            arguments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>There are plenty of 
            reasons to like it, but the most important one might just be the simplicity.  There is a great deal to be
            said for elegant, readable code.</p>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>A points-free version of <code>propEq</code></h2>
    <p>Can we redefine the following in a points-free style?</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>Here's a version that is closer to points-free, removing the direct reference to <code>obj</code>:</p>
        
        
        <p class="slide">
           <code>eq</code> is easy:  like all good functions of multiple parameters, it's curried, and it simply reports
                whether its two arguments are equal.  So <code>eq(val)</code> is a function which reports whether its
                parameter has the same value as does <code>val</code>.  But now we need to discuss <code>compose</code>.
        </p>
    </div>

<section class="slide">
    <h2>Functional composition</h2>
    <p>I have <a href="http://scott.sauyet.com/Javascript/Talk/Compose/">another short talk</a> dedicated entirely to
        techniques of functional composition.  This is a very brief overview:</p>
    <p>In mathematics <code>f &#x2218; g</code> (pronounced "f composed with g") is the function that given <code>x</code>,
       returns <code>f(g(x))</code>.</p>
    <p>So if we follow the mathematical model <code>compose(add1, square)(x)</code> should equal <code>add1(square(x))</code>.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="slide">
        <h3>Simplest Implementation</h3>
        
        <br>
        <p>Note that Ramda also defines <code>pipe</code>, which does much the same thing, but runs the functions
            in the opposite order.  So <code>pipe(add1, square)(x)</code> equals <code>square(add1(x))</code>.  Both
            styles have their uses.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Back to <code>propEq</code></h2>
    <p>So now this definition makes sense:</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>Note the switch from <code>compose</code> to <code>pipe</code>.</p>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>This gives us a further way to clean it up, and make it entirely points-free, using a useful feature of Ramda we
            haven't seen implemented in other libraries, which we call (for now) <code>use-over</code>.  Used like
            <code>use(func).over(transformer1, ... transformerN)</code>, this returns a function which accepts N parameters,
            feeds them to the respective transformers, and then calls <code>func</code> using the results of all these.
            This gives us the final version of propEq:</p>
    </div>
    
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Using our new function</h2>
    <p>This function seems quite useful, and we might want to fold it into Ramda one day, but it's not there now.  Still,
        all these explanations aside, it was only a minute or two of work to do this refactoring and arrive at a
        fairly simple version of <code>propEq</code>.  We would plug it back in like this:</p>
    
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>New objects from old</h2>
    <p>The next block we wanted to update looked like this:</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <h3>Functional version:</h3>
        
        <br>
        <p>You're a smart bunch, right?  I probably don't even have to explain what <code>pick</code> does, right?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="slide">
        <p>Good, then we can move on to discuss <code>map</code>.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>The <code>map</code> function</h2>
    <p><em>It is not down in any map; true places never are. &#x2013; Herman Melville</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>One of the most fundamental functions used in FP is <code>map</code>, which is used to convert one list into
        a related one by running the same function against each member.</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>There isn't much more to say about <code>map</code>, but it's important to point out that this function
            and <code>reduce</code>, which we mentioned briefly earlier, are among the most important functional
            programming tools around.</p>
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Partial clones of our objects.</h2>
    <p>We used <code>map</code> like this:</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>The magic of currying is again at work here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="slide"><code>pick</code> accepts a list of properties and an object and return a partial clone, copying those
            properties from the original.  Since we just pass in the properties, this curried function returns a
            new function that accepts an object and returns that partial clone.</li>
        <li class="slide"><code>map</code> accepts a function and a list an applies the function to the list.  But because it's
            curried, and because we supply only the function generated by the curried <code>pick</code>, this one
            also returns a new function which will accept a list and create these partial clones of each element in
            the list.</li>
        <li class="slide">This function is passed to <code>then</code>, which will simply pass along its parameter (whenever that
            becomes ready) to our function and "return" the result of running our function against it.  (We simply
            know because of the way prior calls have been built that this will be a list of tasks.)</li>
    </ul>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>A final task of some <code>sort</code></h2>
    <p>The last segment we wanted to convert looked like this:</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>We won't discuss the implementation of <code>sortBy</code>, but the basic idea is that it returns a new list
            made from an old one by sorting the elements according to keys generated by the function passed to it.  For
            instance:</p>
        
    </div>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Again with the <code>curry</code></h2>
    <p>Again, we take advantage of the fact that our important functions are curried, and use
        <code>get('dueDate')</code>.  This creates a function that, fed one of our task objects, returns its due date.
        We can feed this into <code>sortBy</code> to get the following:</p>
    
    <div class="slide">
        <br>
        <p>While this is not a <strong>lot</strong> less code than the original:</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>it clearly is a savings.  However, much more importantly, the code is all clearly aimed at our problem.  The
            new code is much closer to a direct translation of the English specifications than is the original.</p>

    <h2>Not the Library</h2>
    <p>It's important to note that nothing in here is meant to promote the Ramda library in particular.</p>
    <p>While I'm certainly partial to it, the only thing that we used in here that was not entirely common to the
        majority of functional programming libraries (across many languages, in fact) was the
        <code>use().over()</code> construct, and all that really gained us was to turn a short function into
        a points-free one-liner.</p>
    <p>Certain libraries make things easier than others, though.  The equivalent code using Underscore or LoDash, which
        don't curry their functions by default, and which choose a different default parameter order, would involve
        significantly more boilerplate.</p>
</section>



<section class="slide">
    <h2>Most Important Functions</h2>
    <p>We've seen what are probably the most important functions in functional programming:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="slide"><code>map</code></li>
        <li class="slide"><code>reduce</code></li>
        <li class="slide"><code>filter</code></li>
        <li class="slide"><code>compose</code></li>
        <li class="slide"><code>curry</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p class="slide">There's one that to some might be conspicuous by it's absence:</p>
    
    <p class="slide">I would argue that this is not actually appropriate to functional programming, as its main
        purpose is to help you achieve side-effects.  But many libraries do include one.</p>

        <li class="slide">Code more closely tied to the problem domain</li>
