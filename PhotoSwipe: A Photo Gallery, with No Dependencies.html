					<h3>Spread to zoom image</h3>
					<p>PhotoSwipe is the first open-source gallery to support JavaScript-based image zooming. Even if a browser&#x2019;s native zooming has been disabled, image zooming will still work.</p>

			<h2>Browser history API</h2>
			<p>PhotoSwipe manipulates the browser&#x2019;s history so that the user can link to each gallery item and close the gallery via the &#x201C;back&#x201D; button. The initial URL is restored when the gallery is closed.</p>

			<figure class="col-50 history-text-left">
				<h3>&#x201C;Back&#x201D; button to close gallery</h3>
				<p>PhotoSwipe adds a history record when the gallery is opened, which allows the user to close it via the browser&#x2019;s &#x201C;back&#x201D; button.</p>
			</figure>
			<figure class="col-50 history-text-right">
				<h3>Unique URL for each gallery item</h3>
				<p>Users can share and link to each image. The hash suffix gets two extra parameters: <code>gid</code> (the gallery index) and <code>pid</code> (the picture index).</p>
			</figure>

		<div class="row">
			<p>This feature comes as a module. You can exclude it from the build entirely, or fork it to fit the requirements of your product&#x2019;s URL structure.</p>

			<h2>Loading and displaying images</h2>
			<p>PhotoSwipe creates the illusion of faster loading.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
	        <div class="col-50">
				<h3>Images display progressively as data arrives</h3>
				<p>Photos are displayed before they fully load. This feature is disabled on touch devices because it could cause swipe transitions to lag.</p>
	        </div>
	        <div class="col-50">
				<h3>Low-resolution images are instantly displayed and then stretched to full size</h3>
				<p>Pass the source of a thumbnail to PhotoSwipe, which will display it instantly and load the full-sized image over top.</p>
	        </div>
	    </div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-50">
				<h3>Smart loading indicator</h3>
				<p>Just a stretched thumbnail or gray placeholder is used, with the full image progressively loaded over top.</p>
				<p><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1797">Luke Wroblewski on spinners</a>:<br>
				&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like watching the clock tick down&#x2014;when you do, time seems to go slower.&#x201D;
				</p>
				<p>If at least tiny part of image has not loaded for 1 second or browser does not support progressive loading, spinning progress indicator smoothly fades in. Delay is added to avoid blinking in case image was cached or user has fast connection.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-50">
				<h3>Zoom animation</h3>
				<p>The zoom transition to open the gallery wasn&#x2019;t added merely for a fancy effect. The image starts loading before the animation, so users on fast connections might not even notice that something was loading.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-50">
				<h3>Smart lazy-loading</h3>
				<p>PhotoSwipe loads neighboring images based on the direction of the user&#x2019;s movement. You can control how many images to preload through the API.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-50">
				<h3>Responsive images support</h3>
				<p>Because images in a gallery are loaded dynamically, you can pass the source that is appropriate to the user&#x2019;s window size and DPI.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		

    </div>


	<div class="section">
		<div class="row title-block">
			<h2>Zoom on the desktop, too</h2>
			<p>PhotoSwipe emulates the default behavior of the browser&#x2019;s image viewer.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-50">
				<h3>Click to zoom image</h3>
				<p>If an image is smaller than the viewport, PhotoSwipe will show a zoom cursor over the image and zoom icon in the top bar.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-50">
				<h3>Pan via the wheel or <span class="highlight">trackpad</span> or by dragging</h3>
				<p>When an image is zoomed in, the user can pan across it via the mouse wheel or the trackpad or by dragging it. And if you need to extend this functionality, you can use the API, of course.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>


    


    <div class="section">

		<div class="row title-block">
			<h2>User interface</h2>
			<p>The UI is entirely separated from the core of the script. If you&#x2019;re making a custom interface for a gallery, you would write it <span class="highlight">instead of the default interface, not on top of it</span>.</p>
		</div>

				<img class="col-img" src="http://photoswipe.com/test/share.png">
				<figure class="img-desc">
					<h3>Social sharing</h3>
					<p>The default UI has a button that pops open a window with sharing links. The default links are for Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, but you can, of course, add more via the API.</p>
				</figure>
	        </div>
	    </div>

					<h3>Native HTML5 full-screen</h3>
					<p>A full-screen image-viewing experience is supported, including on mobile devices with native full-screen support.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="col-50">
				<img class="col-img" src="http://photoswipe.com/test/keyboard.jpg">

					<h3>Keyboard access</h3>
					<p>Galleries can be navigated via the arrow keys and closed via the &#x201C;Escape&#x201D; key. The controls (including the sharing buttons) can be focused on with the &#x201C;Tab&#x201D; button.</p>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</div>

      	<div class="row">
			<h3>Also</h3>
			<p>To draw the most attention to the photos, <span class="highlight">controls are hidden when the mouse hasn&#x2019;t moved</span> for 2 seconds or when the mouse moves off the window.</p>
			<p>PhotoSwipe <span class="highlight">can be closed simply by scrolling the page</span> (on non-touch devices), thus avoiding any extra movement of the mouse.</p>
			<p>The background can be set to any color and transparency level.</p>
			<p>The vertical margins between images can be controlled through an API.</p>
			<p>PhotoSwipe is treated as a modal dialog, so <code>aria</code> attributes are added, and the gallery gains focus when it is open.</p>
      	</div>

    </div>


    <div class="section">
			<div class="row title-block">
			<h2>Problems solved by PhotoSwipe</h2>
			<p>Images are displayed at their highest possible size and are not limited by the width of the column or wrapper. Each image is isolated from the other content and fits the viewport vertically, so that the user can focus on it. If an image is larger than the viewport, it can be zoomed (which most galleries are unable to do).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="row">

			<h3>Detail is preserved in responsive images</h3>
			<p>Let&#x2019;s say the viewport on a user&#x2019;s phone is 500 pixels wide and your uncompressed image is 1200 pixels wide. You wouldn&#x2019;t want to serve such a large image on mobile, so perhaps you&#x2019;d resize it to 500 pixels. But if the image has important details and the user zooms it, it will look pixelated. With PhotoSwipe, when the user taps the small image (500 pixels), the large one will load (1200 pixels), thus preserving all of the detail.</p>

			<h3>Compared to an inline horizontal JavaScript gallery</h3>
			<p>PhotoSwipe will not slow the page from loading, because you can defer loading the gallery&#x2019;s JavaScript file or even load it after the user has clicked the &#x201C;Open gallery&#x201D; button.</p>

			<h3>Compared to a list of images, one after another</h3>
			<p>PhotoSwipe saves users&#x2019; bandwidth because it doesn&#x2019;t load all images at once &#x2014; just nearby images according to the user&#x2019;s direction of movement. Also, it occupies less space on the page, and you can directly link to individual images in a gallery.</p>

		</div>



		<p class="row">
			<h3>PhotoSwipe might not be a good idea if&#x2026;</h3>
			<ul>  
				<li>&#x2026; your images are small or low quality or if there would be no point in zooming or isolating them. Use a simple list of images or a horizontal scroller instead.</li>
				<li>&#x2026; your images are very large and should never be scaled (for example tall infographics with text). Simply link to image file, or create separate HTML page just with image.</li>
				<li>&#x2026; your captions are long or more important than the images themselves. Consider using a simple list of images, with captions below or beside them. And when the user clicks on an image for which a larger version is available, then you could open PhotoSwipe, without the caption, to draw attention to the image itself.</li>
				<li>&#x2026; your website&#x2019;s layout is not fluid. On a non-responsive website on a small screen, PhotoSwipe&#x2019;s controls would look tiny because the page will be zoomed out. Consider using Magnific Popup instead.</li>

	        	<ul class="text-list">
		            <li><code>RequestAnimationFrame</code> is used wherever possible.</li>
		            <li>Only the <code>transform</code> and <code>opacity</code> properties are animated. Almost no paints occur during animation, making transitions as smooth as possible.</li>
		            <li>The frames-per-second (FPS) rate largely depends on the sizes of the images and the device itself. For example, landscape-oriented images that are 1000 pixels wide and displayed in portrait mode on an iPhone 4s running iOS 8 will animate smoothly at 60 FPS. If the images were 1400 pixels wide, then the FPS rate would drop noticeably.</li>

	        	<ul class="text-list">
		            <li>PhotoSwipe keeps only three images in the DOM at once, because each &#x201C;slide&#x201D; is a composited layer, which consumes quite a lot of memory.</li>
		            <li>Almost no memory is consumed until the gallery is first opened.</li>
		            <li>The script has been tested for memory leaks. Navigating images back and forth and creating or deleting a gallery doesn&#x2019;t leave a trace in memory.</li>
	        	</ul>
	        </p>
	    </div>
	    

		<div class="row">
			<h3>Supported browsers and devices</h3>
			<p>The script has been developed to work on every device, which means that basic functionality should be supported everywhere:</p>
			<ul class="text-list">
				<li>desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and IE 8 and above</li>
				<li>Android 2.3.7+ (2.1 not tested yet): default browser, Chrome, Firefox (latest), Dolphin (latest)</li>
				<li>iOS 5+</li>
				<li>Windows Phone 7+: default browser (touch gestures are supported from 8+)</li>
				<li>BlackBerry OS 10+: default browser (older versions not tested yet)</li>
				<li>devices with multiple input methods (Surface, Chromebook Pixel, etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you discover a problem on your device, please <a href="https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe/issues">open an issue on GitHub</a>, and provide as much detail as possible (OS name and version, browser name and version, screenshot or screencast, etc.).</p>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<h3>How PhotoSwipe determines whether a mouse is being used</h3>
			<p>If both touch and mouse input methods are detected, the script waits for two consecutive <code>mousemove</code> events to occur and only then applies the mouse-only features (for example left/right arrow buttons).</p>
	    </div>
		
		<p class="row">
	        <h3>How the zoom animation works for opening images</h3>
	        <ol>
				<li>Once a thumbnail is clicked, its large version instantly starts loading.</li>
				<li>Meanwhile, PhotoSwipe creates a fixed-positioned layer with the duplicated thumbnail image, background, buttons and caption. The background and controls are styled with <code>opacity: 0.001</code> (if it had <code>opacity: 0</code>, the paint would not occur in some browsers).</li>
				<li>A 50-millisecond timer starts. It is added to give the browser time to render the new layers (background, controls, image). Otherwise, the animation would start with a noticeable lag. TODO: change this delay depending on browser/os/device?</li>
				<li>Three CSS transitions start: one scales the image (<code>scale</code> and <code>translate</code> are animated), the second changes the opacity of the background, and the third changes the opacity of the controls.<br>By default, the transition lasts 333 milliseconds.<br>The background is a separate element, because animating <code>opacity</code> looks much smoother than animating an RGBa <code>background-color</code>.</li>
				<li>Once the transition is complete, the large image is added on top of the stretched thumbnail, whether or not it&#x2019;s fully loaded.</li>
				<li>To make the swipe transition smooth, the two neighboring slides are readied at the sides of the viewport.</li>
				<li>If lazy-loading is enabled on more than two neighboring images, then those images would start to load now, too.</li>
			</ol>
	    </p>

		<div class="row">
			<h3>Are PhotoSwipe images crawlable by search engines?</h3>
			<p>PhotoSwipe does not force any HTML markup into the gallery &#x2014; you have full control. Images will be crawlable if you'll have list of links to large images or the images themselves.</p>
