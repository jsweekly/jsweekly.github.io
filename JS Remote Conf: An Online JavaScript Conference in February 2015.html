            <p>There's no excuse not to attend JS Remote Conference. We've eliminated the costs and hassles of travel. (Though you're welcome to get a hotel room if you'd like.) The conference is in the evening, so you don't need to take off work. And the cost is low, so you don't have to drop big bucks to come. We've also offered a Users' Group ticket so you and your friends, co-workers, and colleagues can order some pizza and learn the latest about JavaScript.</p>

<p>We've also gathered the coolest people in JavaScript to speak. Our speakers include developers from popular frameworks like Angular.js and podcasts like JavaScript Jabber and Adventures in Angular.</p>

<p>We want experienced developers and new programmers alike to enjoy the wonderful people and technologies that make up the JavaScript Community. So, we're providing forums before, during, and after the conference for people to ask questions, participate in discussions, and make friends. We're also providing chat rooms during the event for people to discuss talks and ask questions.</p>

<p>So, set your DVR to record your favorite TV shows, fluff up your bunny slippers, and prepare to learn.</p>
