<p>Content is managed in a completely presentation-independent format and can be served to all current and future platforms, including iOS, Android, Google Glass or interactive JavaScript apps.</p>
<p>We are funded by the world&#x2019;s leading VCs, Benchmark&#x2019;s European sister Balderton (MySQL, Redhat, Twitter, New Relic, Dropbox) and SaaS expert Point Nine Capital (ZenDesk, Unbounce, Server Density). Our advisory board includes key personalities from the BBC, Apple, Rovio, Symantec as well as thought leaders in the Web and Content Management space.</p>
<p>We showed significant traction and have paying customers who host big internet properties on Contentful.</p>
<p>The Frontend</p>
<p>Our users manage their content through a sophisticated single-page application, written in AngularJS. We target current evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE11+) to provide the best, smoothest possible user experience inside the browser for solving the complex tasks around content management. Since most of our backend is implemented in Javascript, we share a lot of code between client and server. The frontend application does not only communicate with a REST API but has a realtime connection to the server and other users for collaboratively editing Entries.</p>
<p>As a frontend developer you will work on a complex, modular user interface where API design, application architecture and application state management are the main challenges.</p></section><section class="section section--text"><ul>
